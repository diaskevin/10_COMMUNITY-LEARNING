The primary objective of this chapter is to improve the 'extensibility' of code in the cloud repo
	Clean code prepared in different IDE (.gitignore)
 	Depenency resolution across different project build types (JAR's and maven POM)	

The secondary objective of this chapter is to improve the quality of Chapters 00-09 that is Work In Progress post Rakesh tution  
	Conevtion
 		Chapter Ojectives defined in a CAPITAL LETTERED PROJECT
 		Purpose defined Readme for all projects
 		Technology testing wrt document coverage
  		Work-In-Progress Chapter 95
        	Shift right execution running of chapters 96 - 99:
	 			Dev: 	
     						Evolving changes:  Element names and other changes  
     						Legacy:		   Backward compatability	
    						Obsolete:	   Know when code becomes obsolete but main its backward compatability & runnability  
	 			Ops:		
     						Performance: 	   Across devices
    						Vulnerability: 	   Latest versions run
				    
The third objective of this chapter is to explore 'community learning' as a replacement for one-on-one-tuition (Rakesh) by the use of:
	AI
 	Collaboration on GitHub
  	Community Support on StackOverflow 	
   	Tools Tips (IDE)
   	Class Tuition
    	Support Paid on a one-to-one basis

WIP    Verify use of IntelliJ TIPS to 'write CH01 statement that are of a syntactically correct construct' 
   	Use IntelliJ TIP: Complete the statement Ctrl   Shift   ↩ Enter		 	
       				Start by typing a method declaration, a method call or a statements:
       					if
	    				do -while
	 				try -catch
      					return
	   
OK     Verify Complete the statement on typing a method declaration (AI completed Parenthesis and brackets)
OK     Verify the use of Copilot to review ALL of my Repo project
