# 10_Repo_Extensibility

Observe: Previously covered 'extensibility' of running automation testing:
		CH01 	Convention
				Browser Driver location local 'c:/qa'		
                CH03 	Configuration across several: 
				Browser types		
			  	
CH10
The primary objective of this chapter is to improve the 'extensibility' of code in the cloud repo
	Clean code
 		Different IDE prepared code(.gitignore)
		Device (Window, Linux, Mac)
  		OS versions (i.e. Java 1.8,12,17)
		Depenency resolution across different project build types (JAR's and maven POM)	

The secondary objective of this chapter is to 'basline content' of runnable Chapters 00-09 automations tests.
This requirement will allow a 'constant runner', required to monitored non functional aspects like performance and maturity version control  	
		Conevtion
		 		Chapter Ojectives defined in a CAPITAL LETTERED PROJECT
		 		Purpose defined Readme for all projects
		 		Technology testing wrt document coverage
		Configuration	
				Shift right execution running of chapters 96 - 99:
	 			Dev: 	
     						Evolving changes:  Element names and other changes  
     						Legacy:		   Backward compatability	
    						Obsolete:	   Know when code becomes obsolete but main its backward compatability & runnability  
	 			Ops:		
     						Performance: 	   Across devices
    						Vulnerability: 	   Latest versions run
The third objective of this chapter is to expand 'central management' of tests run on a remote DevOps ephemeral agent:
				Central Reporting
			 	Local Logs 
		     
The fourth objective of this chapter is to indentify & target my 'skill areas' that require maturing (Chapter_95_WIP) i.e.
				DEBUGGING

The fifth objective of this chapter is to improve the 'quality' of Chapters 00-09 using 'new Era' AI technology and open source 'community learning' techniques to replace one-to-one tution  
		New Era Technology
 				Tools Tips (IntelliJ_IDE)-Tips
				AI
 				Collaboration on GitHub
  				Community Support on StackOverflow 	
   			   	Class Tuition
    				Support Paid on a one-to-one basis

WIP	Verify No chapter 99 (no duplicate code)
WIP     Verify chapter for MAC, 
WIP 	Verify Backwardly compatable (Legacy Version & Obsolete)  
WIP    	Verify use of IntelliJ TIPS to 'write CH01 statement that are of a syntactically correct construct' 
	   	Use IntelliJ TIP: Complete the statement Ctrl   Shift   ↩ Enter		 	
	       			Start by typing a method declaration, a method call or a statements:
	       				if
		    			do -while
		 			try -catch
	      				return
WIP     Verify the use of Copilot to review ALL of my Repo project
OK      Verify no Chapter 94 Old duplicate
OK     	Created chapter 95    
OK     	Verify AI_complete_statement on typing a method declaration (AI completed Parenthesis and brackets)
